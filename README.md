# Generator

The only finished part of a bigger project that never came into existence. A RESTful API that was SUPPOSED to handle communication between Web user and Machine Learning program, stored data and validated users by their Google account. The name Generator is pretty misleading, as the project changed many times during developement and at this point holds no real meaning.
